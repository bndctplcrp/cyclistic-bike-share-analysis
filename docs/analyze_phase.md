## Data Limitations

This section outlines known limitations of the Cyclistic bike-share dataset and their potential impact on analysis.

### 1. Historical Scope
The dataset includes trips from 2019 only and does not reflect recent operational, pricing, or behavioral changes.

### 2. Privacy Restrictions
Personally identifiable information (PII) and payment data are excluded, limiting individual-level behavioral profiling and geographic targeting.

### 3. Incomplete Demographic Data
Gender and birth year fields contain missing or unknown values, reducing the reliability of demographic segmentation.

### 4. Trip Duration Outliers
Some rides have unusually short or extremely long durations, which may represent system errors or atypical usage. Median values were used alongside averages to reduce the influence of outliers.

### 5. Station Data Gaps
A small number of records contain missing station IDs or station names.

### 6. Analysis Scope Limitation
The dataset supports behavioral comparison between rider types but does not provide direct insight into rider motivation, intent, or digital engagement patterns.

### Summary

Despite these limitations, the dataset is sufficient to identify clear behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders.
