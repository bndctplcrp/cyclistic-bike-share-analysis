# Data Limitations

This section outlines known limitations of the Cyclistic bike-share dataset and their potential impact on analysis.

## 1. Historical Scope
The dataset only includes trips from 2019 and does not reflect recent operational or behavioral changes.

## 2. Privacy Restrictions
Personally identifiable information and payment data are excluded, limiting individual-level or geographic profiling.

## 3. Incomplete Demographic Data
Gender and birth year fields contain missing or unknown values for some riders.

## 4. Trip Duration Outliers
Some rides have unusually short or long durations, which may represent system errors or non-standard usage.

## 5. Station Data Gaps
A small number of records contain missing station IDs or station names.

## 6. Analysis Scope Limitation
The dataset supports behavioral comparison between rider types but does not provide direct insight into rider motivation or digital engagement.

## Summary
Despite these limitations, the dataset is sufficient to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
