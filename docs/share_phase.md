# Share Phase — Data Visualization & Communication

## Objective

The objective of the Share Phase is to present analytical findings in a clear, structured, and executive-friendly format.

The visualizations were designed to answer the core business question:

**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

The target audience includes:
- Director of Marketing
- Marketing Analytics Team
- Executive Leadership

---

## Dashboard Design Approach

The dashboard was built using Microsoft Excel with PivotTables and the Data Model.

Design principles applied:

- Clear hierarchy (Title → KPIs → Trends → Distribution)
- Consistent color coding (Members vs Casual Riders)
- Minimal visual clutter
- Business-focused chart titles
- Insight-driven layout

Charts were arranged to follow a logical analytical story:

1. Ride Volume (Who rides more?)
2. Ride Duration (How long do they ride?)
3. Weekly Patterns (When do they ride?)
4. Seasonal Trends (How does behavior change over time?)
5. Ride Duration Distribution (Behavioral segmentation)

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Total Annual Rides by Rider Type

Purpose:
To compare overall usage volume between members and casual riders.

Insight:
Members generate significantly more total rides, indicating routine and recurring usage.

---

### 2. Average & Median Ride Duration

Purpose:
To compare trip duration between rider types and assess the influence of outliers.

Insights:
- Casual riders take longer trips on average.
- Median confirms that casual riders consistently ride longer.
- Large gaps between average and median highlight skewed distributions.

---

### 3. Weekly Usage Pattern

Purpose:
To analyze ride frequency by day of week.

Insights:
- Members peak during weekdays.
- Casual riders peak on weekends.
- Clear commuter vs leisure usage distinction.

---

### 4. Monthly Seasonal Trend

Purpose:
To identify seasonal fluctuations.

Insights:
- Both rider types peak in summer (July).
- Casual riders show stronger seasonal variation.
- Members maintain relatively stable year-round usage.

---

### 5. Ride Duration Distribution

Purpose:
To visualize trip duration concentration by rider type.

Insights:
- Members are concentrated in short-duration trips (Under 15 minutes).
- Casual riders show higher proportions in longer ride categories.
- Supports commuter vs recreational segmentation.

---
### 6. Ride Duration Distribution

Purpose:
To visualize how ride duration differs between annual members and casual riders using percentage-based segmentation.

Insights:
- Members are heavily concentrated in short trips (Under 15 minutes).
- Casual riders show higher proportions in longer duration categories (30–60 and 60+ minutes).
- This confirms the commuter vs leisure usage pattern.

Business Relevance:
Understanding trip length concentration supports targeted membership conversion strategies.

## Communication Strategy

The dashboard was designed to:

- Highlight differences clearly and quickly
- Avoid overwhelming executives with technical detail
- Support business decision-making through visual storytelling
- Emphasize actionable insights rather than raw statistics

Short executive summary statements were added to reinforce key findings.

---

## Accessibility & Clarity Considerations

- Clear axis labels
- Percentage formatting where appropriate
- Minimal use of colors for clarity
- High contrast between rider types
- Logical chart grouping

The final dashboard enables non-technical stakeholders to understand behavioral differences without requiring statistical expertise.

## Share Phase Outcome

The visualizations successfully communicate:

- Members are frequent, short-trip, weekday users.
- Casual riders are longer-trip, weekend, and seasonal users.

These communicated insights provide a strong foundation for strategic recommendations in the Act Phase.
